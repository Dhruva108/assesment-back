### 1. Indicate which are the parts of the following url:
- `https://` : _squema_
- `backend.mega-app.com.co :` _host_
- `8080/` : _port_
- `api/articles/search` : _path_
- `?docid=1020&hl=en` : _query string_
- `#dayone` : _fragment_


### 2. Define
##### - Web API
An interface that contains (is made of) fuctions that allows the programmers to manipulate _data_ or _features_ from differents apps.

##### - Restful
As well as we can say that _web api_ is the architecture, _RESTful_ is the aplication of that architecture.

#### - statusCode:
- `200`: _succesful_
- `300`: _redirection_
- `400`: _client error_
- `500`: _server error_

Plus: `100`: _informational_
### 3. CRUD
The module in an app in charge of creation, reading, updating & deleting elements from DB, is also used in Front-End to make the calls to the API; In Back it could be divided in to parts: _services_ and _controllers_ in which both are CRUD but each one has an specyfic responsability.

The anagram means:
`Create` - `Read` - `Update` - `Delete`
